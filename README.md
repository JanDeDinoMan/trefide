# TreFiDe - Trend Filtering Denoising
Dependencies:
1. [CaImAn](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/CaImAn) - follow their setup instructions
2. [CVXPY](https://cvxgrp.github.io/cvxpy/install/index.html) - follow their setup instructions, however on Ubuntu and Py3.6 I found that I first needed to use conda to install blas and lapack as described in the last comment [here](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/issues/357)
